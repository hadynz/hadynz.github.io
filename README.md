Been a long time coming, but finally decided to extend my voice out to the world... and blog!

## Run it locally
The following commands are from [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/)'s documentation for building and running the site.
```shell
jekyll serve
# => A development server will run at http://localhost:4000/

$ jekyll serve --detach
# => Same as `jekyll serve` but will detach from the current terminal.
#    If you need to kill the server, you can `kill -9 1234` where "1234" is the PID.
#    If you cannot find the PID, then do, `ps aux | grep jekyll` and kill the instance. [Read more](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/shell/jobz5.html).

$ jekyll serve --watch
# => Same as `jekyll serve`, but watch for changes and regenerate automatically.
```
