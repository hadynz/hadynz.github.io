I'm Hady and I live in (the most _beautiful_ city in the world) [Auckland](http://www.newzealand.com/int/auckland/), 
New Zealand.

I come from a strong software services background having worked at [IBM](http://ibm.com/nz) and [Datacom](http://datacom.co.nz) 
for around 9 years specialising as a full-stack, jack-of-all trades consultant. However, given my ambition to 
continue evolving the passionate developer in me, I joined [Xero](http://www.xero.com) in 2013 to experience what 
it's like to work for a product based company that cares about finesse, eye for detail and beautiful code that is a 
pleasure to work on everyday.

When I'm not coding after work on a side project (which rarely is the case), I will typically be either training-for or
playing [futsal](http://youtu.be/unFlcSwdDFc) - a game that I have been playing for over 15 years and made me travel 
around the world to places like Australia, Malaysia and even as far as Colombia!

## Why do I blog?
My primary motivation behind this blog is for it to become a repository of all my thoughts and learnings that I
have gathered over the years when jumping between tech-stacks, projects and companies. You will see me posting 
many code samples that either took me lots of time (and pulled hair) to work out, or little precious gems that I 
would like to have available for me at anytime.

Now _I'm_ not the only primary audience that I target! The other target segment for this blog is _you_. I feel a lot
of self fulfilment when I see that knowledge that I share with others has helped fix problems they've run into, or 
at least inspired them down the right track that they have been looking for. Now I am unsure if my blog would
actually achieve that, but I do really hope that readers will find some value here.

## About this blog
This blog is probably around my 5th attempt of creating an online presence for myself in many, many years. I started off
with a blog running on Wordpress, moved to Tumblr, and not long after it had moved again on to Drupal. The reason
I was not able to stay in one place is because each platform did not quite do what I wanted. Being the perfectionist
that I sometimes can be, I kept getting distracted by tinkering with platform configuration and plugins, instead of
 _actually_ writing.
 
Getting sick of making excuses for myself, I finally decided to absolutely commit to getting a blog up and running, 
and the solution came in the form of using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static website generator, and host it on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Why was this platform any different? Well writing posts in 
[Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and having complete control over my site templates almost felt 
like coding (_fun!_) and not tedious content authoring. GitHub pages also provided me with the ability of allowing 
readers to contribute to anything I write - an idea inspired by [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/)'s blog which excited 
me to try out as well.

I code, write and publish my blog posts using my favourite and trusty [WebStorm IDE](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm).

I also need to extend my gratitude to [@SylvainLafitte](https://twitter.com/SylvainLafitte) for helping me with the 
site's typography, and my dearest wife [@DandoonG](https://twitter.com/DandoonG) for her constant feedback during the 
blog's development.
