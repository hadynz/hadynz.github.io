I'm Hady and this is my blog. I am a front end developer at [Xero](http://www.xero.com) working on the 
[Practice Manager](https://www.xero.com/nz/practicemanager/) team.

### Why do I blog?
This is the key for me. I joke that I use my blog instead of a brain, but that's not too far from the truth! I started 
blogging because I changed jobs relatively often and kept losing my "useful scripts" directory with each job move. So 
instead of putting text files in a directory, I started putting code samples into a blog, with the intention that I'd 
be able to find them later. I still blog this way, things I want to remember, stuff that I want to tell people about 
events that I'm going to, and so on. I have no idea why so many people read the things I write but I hope they find 
value here.

The flip-side of this is that although I am a statistics nut and watch my google analytics stats quite closely, I 
don't really write for that purpose. I blog to publicly "remember" things, and the site doesn't make money at all 
so it doesn't make any difference to me whether I see 100 hits or 1000 hits on any given day. I am interested about 
what brings in the traffic, because it tells me when topics are of interest in the industry, but I usually only write 
posts about things other than what I am actively working on if someone asks me to do so (requests always welcome).

## Write for Yourself
This is the key for me. I joke that I use my blog instead of a brain, but that's not too far from the truth! I started
