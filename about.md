I'm Hady and I live in (the most _beautiful_ city in the world) [Auckland](http://www.newzealand.com/int/auckland/), 
New Zealand.

I come from a strong software services background having worked at [IBM](http://ibm.com/nz) and [Datacom](http://datacom.co.nz) 
for around 9 years specialising as a full-stack, jack-of-all trades consultant. However, given my ambition to 
continue evolving the passionate developer in me, I joined [Xero](http://www.xero.com) in 2013 to experience what 
it's like to work for a product based company that cares about finesse, eye for detail and beautiful code that is a 
pleasure to work on everyday.

When I'm not coding after work on a side project (which rarely is the case), I will typically be either training-for or
playing [futsal](http://youtu.be/unFlcSwdDFc) - a game that I have been playing for over 15 years and made me travel 
around the world to places like Australia, Malaysia and even as far as Colombia!

## Why do I blog?
My primary motivation behind this blog is for it to become a repository of all my thoughts and learnings that I
have gathered over the years when jumping between tech-stacks, projects and companies. You will see me posting 
many code samples that either took me lots of time (and pulled hair) to work out, or little precious gems that I 
would like to have available for me at anytime.

Now _I'm_ not the only primary audience that I target! The other target segment for this blog is _you_. I feel a lot
of self fulfilment when I see that knowledge that I share with others help fix problems they run into, or inspire
them down the right track that they have been looking for. I am unsure how many people will read the things I share,
but I hope that there will be value here.
