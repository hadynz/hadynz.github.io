Post that talks about the reasons why I went down with Jekyll

* I am a developer and strongly motivated coding and not necessarily writing.
* Jekyll makes it almost feel that I am coding to write a blog post... at least on the initial phase
* Love Markdown and not being bogged down with messy HTML generated by some WYSIWYG editor
* Pushing changes to my theme and having control over the blog is extremely simple
* Love the idea about opening the blog for others to contribute via a pull request! Yet to have anyone actually
contribute. To entic peple I hv purpsly left severl misspellingz in ts sntence to provoke the perfctionist 
in readers.
