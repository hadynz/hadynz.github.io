Microservices are very much in hot trend today with its touted benefits of allowing teams to develop, deploy
and scale business systems independently. Yet when it comes to testing (and developing) microservices, the 
mindset and techniques employed by teams are often still fixated around thinking about them in unison. This 
talk reflects on the challenges of implementing microservices and discuss a spectrum of testing thinking 
to consider.

This talk was presented at [Code Camp Wellington][1].
