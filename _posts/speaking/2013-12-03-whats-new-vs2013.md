Visual Studio is the de facto IDE for developers working on the Microsoft platform and the IDE of choice for many 
web developers as well.

This talk introduces what is new in Visual Studio 2013 and puts a spotlight on how it evolved from an integrated 
development environment for the desktop, to an IDE that now extends its reach with a collection of developer services, 
hosted in Azure, which offers a compelling integrated end-to-end development experience for modern applications.

This presentation also demonstrated the simplicity of creating a Push Notification service for a prototype app 
that runs as a web app (HTML/JS), Windows 8 app and on Android.

The talk was part of a Microsoft NZ-led event discussing designing and building beautiful front-end websites on 
December 3, 2013 - http://bit.ly/1bVtshl.
