Many software development teams are formed for extended periods of time and never reach a point were they
are acknowledged by their organisations or even themselves as high performing teams. Yet, when the right
environment is created for a team that can reach that potential, these teams tend to punch above their weight
and deliver value greater than the sum of the individual talent in the team.

In this talk I explore the philosophies underpinning human motivation that we employ in our teams at Xero 
to build high performing teams. I also share key principles that we work to build in our culture to foster
an environment that taps into the deap-seated desired of our people's needs to expand on their abilities
and do the best work of their lives in our organisation.

This talk was presented to a postgrad class on Contemporary Methods in [Software Engineering at AUT][1].
