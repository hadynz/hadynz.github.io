When I was working as an engagement manager at Datacom, one of the clients that I worked with was very closely was
Auckland Airport. As part of one of our engagements together, we worked together on laying down a digital strategy
for the business and took a phase approach at delivering it.

This [webinar](http://www.sitecore.net/Resources/webinars/Up-Up-and-Away-Auckland-Airport-Takes-Off-with-Website-Personalization.aspx)
was hosted by Sitecore after Auckland Airport won two of of their 
[2013 Sitecore Site of the Year Awards](http://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/en/Corporate/NewsAndMedia/AllMediaReleases/Airport-celebrates-prestigious-Australasian-website-awards.aspx)
 - Business Transformation and the Peopleâ€™s Choice Award.

The talk goes through the journey that all the different vendors undertook together and shares many of the key
learnings found during the way. My personal focus was on how we implemented several of the solution requirements in
Sitecore and how some out of the box thinking simplified problems and saved cost.
