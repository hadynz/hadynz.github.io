This was a lightning talk that I gave at [Agile Auckland][1] about an experiment that we ran at work with self reorganising teams.

The origin of the experiment started when we had two development teams that lacked enough people with a demanding backlog and a third team that didn't have suitable work to fit their capability. After giving up on manually solving the problem by changing the team makeup behind closed doors, we opted to throw the problem back at all three teams to work out the best way to deliver the work.

The talk covers the initial problem statement in detail and walksthrough how we conducted the self organisation exercise.
